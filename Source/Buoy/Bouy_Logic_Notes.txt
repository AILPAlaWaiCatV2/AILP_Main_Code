Logic for Differentiating between buoys (ID)

using  ID numbers prior to sending data to make sure node knows where it is coming from

Seperate Channels  

Requirements: (Per Buoy)
LoRa Transciever x2
Arduino Uno x2
NodeMCU x1
---- Atlas-Scientific ----
Tentacle shield x1
Temperature sensor x1
pH sensor x1
Conductivity x1
Dissolved Oxygen x1


Buoy 1:
	Buoy Name: B1
	Temperature: B1T
	pH: B1P
	Conductivity: B1C
	Dissolved Oxygen: B1D
Buoy 2:
	Buoy Name: B2
	Temperature: B2T
	pH: B2P
	Conductivity: B2C
	Dissolved Oxygen: B2D

ect...
