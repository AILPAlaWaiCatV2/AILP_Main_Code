# AILP_Main_Code
## Project Synopsis
The main objective of this project is to create an autonomous catamaran that will deploy bouys that collect temperature, pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen to better understand the Ala Wai. There are three parts to this projects programming aspect. The first part is the autonomous coding and relaying of GPS data from the catamaran. The second portion cosists of the bouys and the data transmition to a google sheet. The third aspect is the getting and pushing of data from google sheet into a website that is user interactive and displays data received form the bouys and catamaran. In this repository, the second aspect, being the bouys, is used to transmit data from the buoy to a access point and then to the internet, making this project not only a LoRa project but also an IoT project. 

This is one of many projects that is monitoring the Ala Wai watershed. This project is helping the group of scientists, teachers, and students apart of the [Na Wai 'Ekolu](https://www.nawaiekolu.org/). This overarching project is to inspire and get citixen research out there to create a database for watershed helth and even watershed biodiversity. This data collecting project will be used along multiple areas on the Ala Wai to get a better understanding on the change in enviorment throught the island.

## Getting Started
This section describes the nmaterials and software needed to create this project. These are just the basic needs to create the temperature collecting monitoring system. Other software and sensors can be added if needed. 

### Materials Needed
These are the supplies needed to complete this project.
